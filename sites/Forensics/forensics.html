                 </figure>
                  <h4>Goals and Intent</h4>
                  <p style="text-indent: 40px">This is where we talk about what it is supposed to do. I'm gonna go on a rambling word vomit here to create a paragraph, but what I believe NAGPRA is supposed to do, without doing an research as of now, is that it is supposed to protect the individuals that are found and return them to their living descendents and have them reburried as they would have wanted. I realize that the act was made with the living Indigenous peoples in mind, but I believe it is more important to protect the rights of the dead in this case, as we know they most likely would not have consented to being examined. They would have wanted to be burried by their surviving relatives. </p>
                  <h4>Weaknesses</h4>
                   <p style="text-indent: 40px"> Although NAGPRA’s intentions were to protect the rights of the Indigenous Tribes and their ancestors, many of its shortcomings were revealed right away. NAGPRA prevented the start of new scientific studies of Indigenous remains, but it didn’t enforce the end of current studies or require museums to determine the cultural affiliation of the remains. This means that museums and scientists had complete say over which studies were necessary to continue, or they could just refuse to figure out which tribe the remains are most closely related to, making repatriation impossible. Another issue was that NAGPRA can only protect indigenous remains on federal land, it has no power over remains discovered on private property. Many believe this is due to it infringing on the landowners rights, yet many states have passed their own legislation protecting remains on public and private property. These legislations were deemed constitutional, so many Indigenous peoples don’t understand why NAGPRA wasn’t expanded to include private land. This causes a problem because, according to the U.S. Department of Agriculture in 1978, 33% of U.S. land is federally owned and 60% is private land. Although this is a fairly old statistic, current documents suggest that privately owned land has only increased by one or two percentage points. This leaves over half of U.S. land not under NAGPRA, leading to a vast amount or remains unprotected.</p>

                  <h3>The Story of the Kennewick Man</h3>
                  <hr>
                  <h4>The Discovery</h4>
                    <figure style="padding-left:20px; padding-bottom: 5px; float: right; width: 30%">
                      <img src="img/unnamed.jpg" width="100%">
                      <figcaption><a href="#" rel="citation" data-toggle="popover" data-content="Image 2: Taken by Howard Frisk Photography">Image of the Columbia River, where the Kennewick man was discovered</a></figcaption>
                    </figure>
                    <p style="text-indent: 40px"> The Kennewick man was discovered during the summer of 1996, when two students from a nearby college tripped on his skull while wading in the Columbia River. They were concerned that they had just stumbled upon a homicide victim and immediately called the police. It came as a surprise when it was discovered that the skeleton was of a 9,000 year old Indigenous man. Once this news circulated, an immediate battle over who had custody of him sprang out of the woodwork. The group that managed the land where he was found, the Army Corps of Engineers, claimed they had authority and stated that they would be making the decisions of this case moving forward. They tried to halt all scientific study, but the coroner argued that it was he who actually had authority, which led to the Kennewick man being placed in an evidence locker until the issue was resolved. This then led to a lengthy legal battle between anthropologists and scientists against the Army Corps of Engineers and Indigenous tribes.</p>
                  <h4>The Dispute</h4>
                  <h5>The Plaintiffs</h5>
                  <p style="text-indent: 40px"> I'm pretty sure this group was the scientists as they were the ones that took action and brought the case to court. They believed that it was wrong for the Kennewick man to be returned without being able to research it first, as it is one of the most well preserved, practically complete ancient skeltons ever. They won with this argument after multiple trials, despite later evidence forcing them to return him.</p>
                  <h5>The Defendents</h5>
                  <p style="text-indent: 40px"> This should be the Colville Tribe and that one godforsaken company that I can't for the life of me remember currently. They argued that the Kennewick man was an ancestor of theirs and that he should be returned to them immediately for reburial, as in a lot of indigenous culture, a body needs to be buried so the soul can rest. They eventually were able to rebury him, as DNA tests on him revealed that he was closely related to their tribe.</p>
                  <h4>The Outcome</h4>
                  <p style="text-indent: 40px"> After twenty long years in and out of court, the Kennewick man was finally returned to the Colville Tribe. In April? of 2017, he was buried at a sacred burial ground of the tribe that I cannot remember</p>

                  <h3>Looking to the Future</h3>
                  <hr>
                  <h4>Improvements to NAGPRA</h4>
                  <p style="text-indent: 40px"> I'm not sure what I'm supposed to put here at all I'm gonna leave it to you paige but for now I'm going to word vomit until I can get a sizable paragraph to see the shape and layout. This is actually theraputic it's like taking my brain and putting it to paper. I should really start journaling again I don't why I stopped. We are going to say that this is enough because we are getting closer to the end of class and I need to vomit the next paragraph.</p>
                  <h4>Future Research</h4>
                  <p style="text-indent: 40px"> Again, word vomiting here, I'm listening to classical music right now in case you were wondering. It's a cello piece by some person named Camille and a crazy last name I can't spell; its got the german double dot thing over one of the E's. But it's really pretty, but really sad, as most cello classical music is. Cellos just have a really somber sound to them which make them perfect for sad songs, but if you play it lightly and at a quick place you can get a really lighthearted song.</p>
