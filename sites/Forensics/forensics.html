                  <h5 style="text-indent: 40px">The Twenty Year Long Battle</h5>
                  <h4>The Colville Tribe in Kennewick, Washington</h4>
         	        <h5 style="text-indent: 40px">By: Paige Brewbaker and Mikayla Calverley</h5>
                <div>
                  <h3>The Native American Grave Protection and Repatration Act (NAGPRA)</h3>
         		      <hr><!--this draws a line across the page, which I put under each section heading in the example-->
                  <h4>Goals and Intent</h4>
                  <p style="text-indent: 40px">This is where we talk about what it is supposed to do. I'm gonna go on a rambling word vomit here to create a paragraph, but what I believe NAGPRA is supposed to do, without doing an research as of now, is that it is supposed to protect the individuals that are found and return them to their living descendents and have them reburried as they would have wanted. I realize that the act was made with the living Indigenous peoples in mind, but I believe it is more important to protect the rights of the dead in this case, as we know they most likely would not have consented to being examined. They would have wanted to be burried by their surviving relatives. </p>
                  <h4>Weaknesses</h4>
         		       <p style="text-indent: 40px"> Question: What is wrong with NAGPRA? Answer: So so many things.</p>
                   <br>
                   <p style="text-indent: 40px"> One weakness is NAGPRA focuses on the rights of the living when it should really focus on the rights of the dead individuals found. I'm scrambling right now I'm so tired</p>

                  <h3>The Story of the Kennewick Man</h3>
                  <hr>
                  <h4>The Discovery</h4>
                  <p style="text-indent: 40px"> Again this is going to be crap because I don't feel like fact checking, however, if I remember correctly a group of college students stumbled upon the skull of the Kennewick man. They immediately called the police, as they were concerned that the skull was modern. It was quickly determined that the skeleton was over eight thousand years old. This one group, I forget the name, immediately decided to give the Kennewick man to the Colville Tribe for reburial. Scientists all over the world fought against it, and ended up taking it to court.</p>
                  <h4>The Dispute</h4>
                  <h5>The Plaintiffs</h5>
                  <p style="text-indent: 40px"> I'm pretty sure this group was the scientists as they were the ones that took action and brought the case to court. They believed that it was wrong for the Kennewick man to be returned without being able to research it first, as it is one of the most well preserved, practically complete ancient skeltons ever. They won with this argument after multiple trials, despite later evidence forcing them to return him.</p>
                  <h5>The Defendents</h5>
                  <p style="text-indent: 40px"> This should be the Colville Tribe and that one godforsaken company that I can't for the life of me remember currently. They argued that the Kennewick man was an ancestor of theirs and that he should be returned to them immediately for reburial, as in a lot of indigenous culture, a body needs to be buried so the soul can rest. They eventually were able to rebury him, as DNA tests on him revealed that he was closely related to their tribe.</p>
                  <h4>The Outcome</h4>
                  <p style="text-indent: 40px"> After twenty long years in and out of court, the Kennewick man was finally returned to the Colville Tribe. In April? of 2017, he was buried at a sacred burial ground of the tribe that I cannot remember</p>
