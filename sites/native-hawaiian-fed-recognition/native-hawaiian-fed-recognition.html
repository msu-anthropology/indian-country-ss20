     <p>Why don’t Native Hawaiians have federal recognition from the United States government when they have been looking to gain it for years? Native Hawaiians, along with plenty of other native communities throughout the continental United States, are still trying to gain federal recognition for their communities. This process of gaining federal recognition has taken years to have any kind of action taken on it. People within the Native Hawaiian communities are both for and against gaining federal recognition. The process of gaining federal recognition for any native community has both positive and negatives. The most obvious positive of federal recognition is that a specific Native community is once again recognized as a sovereign nation within a nation. The biggest negative of gaining federal recognition is that people within the Native Hawaiian community are wanting complete independence from the United States.</p>

        <h3>Brief History of Hawaiian Government</h3>

        <p>Why Hawaii is part of the US? The history of the Hawaiian government begins when “Polynesian navigators first discovered the Hawaiian Islands more than a millennium ago, and for the next 1,000 years, flourished as a self-sustaining and self-governing people” (Hilleary, 2019).Then Hawaii became a part of the United States based mostly on its Geopolitical location and how it could be of use to the United States military. The U.S. Military presences was covered in a <a href= "https://msu-anthropology.github.io/indian-country-ss18/sites/us-military-hawaii/us-military-hawaii.html">previous project Dinah George</a>. </p>
          <p>The U.S. government illegally overthrew the queen of Hawaii, Queen Liliuokalani. This overthrow happened because the U.S. Military deemed Hawaii an essential place for a military base in 1893. Queen Liliuokalani was afraid of the U.S. military, so she ceded her authority to the United States (Trask, 2000). The Queen of Hawaii was not able to claim back her throne thus leaving the native people of Hawaii under the authority of the United States. It wasn’t until 1953 that Hawaii achieved statehood in the United States (Trask, 2000). It wasn’t until the Clinton administration that the United States government officially apologized for the overthrow of the Queen of Hawaii (Trask, 2000).</p>

        <h3>The Akaka Bill</h3>
        <figure style="float: right; width: 25%; padding-right: 20px; padding-bottom: 5px;">

        <p> The Native Hawaiian Government Reorganization Act of 2005, which is also known as the Akaka Bill. It’s is named the Akaka Bill after Senator Dan Akaka who advocated for Native Hawaiians gaining federal recognition. The Akaka Bill is meant to establish a government-to-government relationship between Native Hawaiians and the United States (Pybas, 2005). The importance of the Akaka Bill to Native Hawaiians is for many reasons. The most important reason is that the bill refers to them collectively as “Native Hawaiians” and does not mention being part of a specific tribe. This would allow for greater protection for Native Hawaiians and allow them “to exercise self-determination and self-governance within the confines of U.S. law” (Pybas, 2005). To sum up <blockquote cite=https://www-jstor-org.proxy1.cl.msu.edu/stable/pdf/20070751.pdf?refreqid=excelsior%3A7202c0dc1295be92c30fb17c31e8e2e8> “Native Hawaiians will need the support of the Supreme Court to succeed in their argument that they are an Indian tribe. Without an increased interest on the part of the Supreme Court, the success of Native Hawaiians' endeavor to be recognized as an "Indian tribe" seems unlikely. Without a change, legislation that benefits Native Hawaiians will be analyzed on the same level as legislation benefitting African Americans, Caucasians, or Asian Americans ... with strict scrutiny” (Pybas, 2005).

        <h3>Native Hawaiians Opinions</h3>
        <p>Contrary to what some people may assume Native Hawaiians have not just recently begun petitioning for sovereignty. Native Hawaiians did not take a back seat when being colonized. They fought back by resisting colonization through organizations and petitions (Hilleary, 2019). The movement for sovereignty really gained attention on the 100th anniversary of the overthrow of the Queen of Hawaii. Since gaining followers there have been a seperation into two seperate groups, those who want complete independence from the United States, and those who are seeking to be recognized as a nation within a nation relationship with the United States (Hilleary, 2019). Davianna Pomaika'i McGregor, a Hawaii historian states that "I’m very much in favor of reorganizing our government as a native people, not the government of the state of Hawaii as a whole, but the quest to reestablish an independent Native Hawaiian government within an independent Hawaii" (Hilleary, 2019).
        </p>

        </figure>
        <p>The United States government wanted to find out the Native Hawaiians stance on gaining federal recognition. "In the summer of 2014, the U.S. Department of the Interior or DOI held a series of 15 public hearings throughout the Hawaiian islands" (Altemus-Williams, 2015). The main argument throughout these hearings was that the Native Hawaiians did not want the United States government involved in the nation of the Native Hawaiians. To give an idea numbers wise of the amount of Native Hawaiians that want to gain federal recognition "An online poll conducted by the Honolulu Star Advertiser newspaper asked whether the DOI should “keep open the process for federal recognition of Native Hawaiians,” 67 percent of participants said “no”" (Altemus-Williams, 2015). That is more than half, so why is this process still on-going when it does not seem like either party wants it? The answer is simple, it's the second best option for Native Hawaiians that want to reestablish complete independence from the United States government.

        <h4> Conclusion </h4>
        <p>The process of gaining federal recognition is seemingly endless, second best option for the Native people of America. The process of colonization took away these people’s land and then forced our way of governing onto them. This is not something that can be rectified overnight or with a simple solution. There are millions of people living on the islands of Hawaii and any decision made by legislation would affect each and every one of them. Since Native Hawaiians are still in the initial phases of petitioning to gain legislation to achieve federal recognition it will most likely take years to see any change on this political front. The future for Native Hawaiians governance and self-determination is up in the air, but it is quite obvious that their voices will be heard and changed will be made.
