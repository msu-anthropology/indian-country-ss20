         <h3>FIRST SECTION HEADING</h3>
		 <hr><!--this draws a line across the page, which I put under each section heading in the example-->
		 <p>In a world that is extremely technologically dependent, internet and computer access in the home has become a necessity for every person in our society. But, until governments provide equal accessibility, many individuals and communities will continue to be negatively affected by lack of affordable internet access, and lack of access in their community all together. Schools, businesses, and even government offices, assume that most people have a computer and internet in the home. And while that may be true, most, isn’t all, so people are being left behind by this way of thinking. Even more unfortunate, the people that are being left behind in this matter, are the already vulnerable and/or targeted groups of our world, and are disproportionately members of Native American Tribes. To combat this inequality, many rural Native Tribes are creating their own internet providers to provide their communities with the necessary tools and resources to access the internet. We look here, at the Hopi Tribe’s response to the lack of connectivity they faced and their plan--and execution--to not only get online, but to use the internet to boost their community’s economy and education programs.</p>

<h3> Section 2 </h3>

<p>According to Indiaz.com , “Only about 29% of Hopi households have access to broadband, compared to 79% in Arizona and 78% nationwide.”
Half the world's population is now under the age of 20. This means that children now are growing up in an era that is based around technology. With the lack of technology in a society, it causes a lack of knowledge putting them at a disadvantage. Many indigenous communities don't have the resources for teaching students the technical knowledge that other children are being brought up with. Though these communities of people live in a developed country does not mean they are receiving the same amount of resources. They are extremely underdeveloped compared to other communities in the country. Lack of access to computer and technology skills will lead to an entire generation to be disempowered. They will miss many opportunities in their careers due to this disadvantage. Having access to the internet would allow these indigenous communities to have a bigger voice within the media and there would be less of a divide between cultures.
