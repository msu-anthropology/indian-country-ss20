         <h3>Introduction</h3>
		 <hr><!--this draws a line across the page, which I put under each section heading in the example-->
		 <p>Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry. Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book. It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged. It was popularised in the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently with desktop publishing software like Aldus PageMaker including versions of Lorem Ipsum.
     </p>

<p> Why do we use it?
It is a long established fact that a reader will be distracted by the readable content of a page when looking at its layout. The point of using Lorem Ipsum is that it has a more-or-less normal distribution of letters, as opposed to using 'Content here, content here', making it look like readable English. Many desktop publishing packages and web page editors now use Lorem Ipsum as their default model text, and a search for 'lorem ipsum' will uncover many web sites still in their infancy. Various versions have evolved over the years, sometimes by accident, sometimes on purpose (injected humour and the like). </p>

<p>Where does it come from?
Contrary to popular belief, Lorem Ipsum is not simply random text. It has roots in a piece of classical Latin literature from 45 BC, making it over 2000 years old. Richard McClintock, a Latin professor at Hampden-Sydney College in Virginia, looked up one of the more obscure Latin words, consectetur, from a Lorem Ipsum passage, and going through the cites of the word in classical literature, discovered the undoubtable source. Lorem Ipsum comes from sections 1.10.32 and 1.10.33 of "de Finibus Bonorum et Malorum" (The Extremes of Good and Evil) by Cicero, written in 45 BC. This book is a treatise on the theory of ethics, very popular during the Renaissance. The first line of Lorem Ipsum, "Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet..", comes from a line in section 1.10.32.
</p>

<p>The standard chunk of Lorem Ipsum used since the 1500s is reproduced below for those interested. Sections 1.10.32 and 1.10.33 from "de Finibus Bonorum et Malorum" by Cicero are also reproduced in their exact original form, accompanied by English versions from the 1914 translation by H. Rackham.</p>

<h3>History of Indigenous Midwifery</h3>
<hr>
<p> Spongebob Ipsum is a place where you will be able to find all kinds of generators, just as random name generators, job titles generators, random song title generators and so on. There are also a lot of other types of generators which you would never probably have thought of! If you have not checked the site out yet, you definitely should do so and you will be guaranteed to be in awe at all the different kinds of generators that are found there.</p>

<p> The person who created the site is personally a very indecisive person and sometimes find it hard to come up with name for his projects and other stuff which is why he created this particular site to help out anyone who is feeling the same way as him. Some of the generators are made for fun though and they may not be suited for non-adults so if you have kids who need to use these generators, maybe you should help them to use it instead first.</p>

<p> Apart from these generators, you may also find a bit of trivia, pictures and other stuff about Spongebob on the site, because obviously the creator of the site is a fan of Spongebob if not he would not have named the site after the cartoon Spongebob. If you are just a fan of Spongebob and just want someone to talk to regarding the cartoon Spongebob, you can also do so through the contact form on the page and I am sure he will be more than willing to entertain you.</p>

<p> All in in, if you are either a Spongebob fanatic or just someone who needs help generating random names for almost anything you can think of under the Sun, this place is definitely the right place for you. Hope that you have an enjoyable and pleasant stay here.
