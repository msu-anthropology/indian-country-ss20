      <h1>Gendered Violence</h1>
      <h3>Navajo Nation</h3>
	  <h4>Bethany Malinowski</h4>
         <h3>Introduction</h3>
		 <hr><!--this draws a line across the page, which I put under each section heading in the example-->
		 <p>All over the United States, Indian Country is severely affected by gendered violence. The Navajo Nation is no exception, as the women in this tribe face violence at a much higher rate than non-native people. Gendered violence is violence that is aimed at someone because of the gender that they are, mostly affecting women. It can include any form of violence from psychological, sexual, and physical harm. This case study looks at the different forms of violence women in the Navajo Nation deal with and how they handle it. Navajo Nation sits in the northeast corner of Arizona while spreading into Utah and New Mexico. Navajo Nation is the second largest Indian tribe in the United States with about 150,000 Navajo people living on the reservation and about 330,000 enrolled as Navajo people. The traditional role of women in the Navajo Nation is very prominent as it is a matrilineal society. Women are lead a strong role within their society and culture. These women, though, are facing different forms of violence at disproportionately higher rates than people outside of Indian Country.

     <h3>Gender & Femininity</h3>
     <hr><!--this draws a line across the page, which I put under each section heading in the example-->
<p>Generally gender within Native American cultures plays a rather large role, and the Navajo culture is no exception. Woman, or asdzaan, are traditionally the most important gender out of all of the genders because of the role asdzaan play in their traditional stories and spirituality. The story and spiritual belief of the Changing Woman has a very impactful role in how women are seen in Navajo culture, as it is fundamental to their culture. The Changing Woman is one of the most important deities to Navajo people; she acts as a representation of Mother Earth, femininity, child bearing, power, and more. She is a deity women in the tribe can look up to and emulate. Navajo culture is fundamentally matriarchal with asdzaan being the head of the household as well as the leading decision makers.
</p>
<p>Miss Navajo is also an influential role portrayed by a woman in the Navajo culture. She is chosen each year after a pageant is put on that showcases different young women a part of the Navajo Nation by looking at their various talents related to being a part of the tribe, “The pageant consists of Traditional Techniques, Public Speaking, Panel Questions, Contemporary Skills and Talent, Traditional Skills and Talent and Evening Gown competitions. The panel of judges utilizes a point system and the contestant with the greatest number of points is crowned Miss Navajo”. Miss Navajo allows for the culture to be preserved, shared, and taught to people all over the world, including around the reservation by educating and representing the her tribe, “Miss Navajo’s duties are to promote and educate Navajo culture, language and traditions”.

     <h3>Numbers on Violence</h3>
     <hr><!--this draws a line across the page, which I put under each section heading in the example-->
<p>Gendered violence within Navajo Nation, and all over Indian Country is a massive issue. It affects the community in huge numbers, much bigger than the national averages. It is an incredibly common problem that plagues the Navajo Nation reservation and its people. Just like the rest of the Native American women in the United States, the Navajo women face a significantly high level of violence compared to non-native Americans. Violent acts that these women face include different forms of sexual assault, domestic violence like physical abuse, and more. Native American women are at a much higher risk of being a victim of violence at about two times more likely than African Americans and white people, and about four and a half times more likely than Asian Americans. For every 1,000 Native women, there are 124 who are victims of violence. Women on reservations who are victims of violence, particularly partner violence, are more likely than most to have to go to the hospital, have PTSD, have anxiety, and other mental health problems. Because Native women experience violence more frequently than other groups of people, the consequences will affect a lot more people.

     <h3>What is being done?</h3>
     <hr><!--this draws a line across the page, which I put under each section heading in the example-->
<p>Native Americans have taken the issue of gendered violence into their own hands. There are several different things on and off the Navajo reservation that are helping Native women stay safe, including new policy and community services. On April 3rd, 2019 Council member of the Navajo Nation government designated April as the Navajo Nation Sexual Assault Awareness Month to bring more awareness to the issue. In accordance to this, the Navajo Nation Council has been trying to get the state and federal government to reauthorize the Violence Against Women Act (VAWA) to help create change for women. VAWA, while previously enacted, has expired in February of 2019. The act has helped Native women since 2013 by allowing tribal courts to prosecute non-native perpetrators on the basis that they have committed specific sexual crimes, whereas prior to the bill tribes were not allowed to prosecute any non-native person. This made it much harder for women to get justice for the people who wronged them. Now that the bill has expired, it has recently passed through the House of Representatives and is on its way through the Senate. It is critical that it passes. Another piece of legislation that has been crucial to the Navajo Nation is the Domestic Abuse Prevention Act. The purpose of this act is to criminalize domestic violence through tribal jurisdiction. It aims to:
  <ol>
  <li>To recognize the illegal nature of domestic abuse;</li>
  <li>To provide victims of domestic abuse with the maximum protection from abuse that can be made available under the law;</li>
  <li>To establish an efficient and flexible remedy that discourages violence against and harassment of persons within a family or clan setting, or others with whom the abuser has continuing contact;</li>
  <li>To expand the ability of law enforcement officers to assist victims, to enforce existing laws, and to prevent subsequent incidents of abuse;</li>
  <li>To facilitate the reporting of domestic abuse;</li>
  <li>To develop a greater understanding of the incidence and causes of domestic abuse by encouraging data collection and evaluation; and</li>
  <li>To reduce the incidence of domestic abuse, which has a detrimental and lasting effect on the individual, the family, culture, and society.</li>
</ol>

</p>
<p>Other ways Navajo people are combating gendered violence are through community events. A group of tribal members in Window Rock, Arizona held a fashion show in February 2019 dedicated to bringing awareness to domestic violence. The event, Domestic Violence Prevention Awareness & Fashion Show, put on by the Strengthening Families Program included many different motivational speakers, including the Navajo Nation First Lady Phefelia Herbert-Nez and Miss Navajo 2018 Autumn Montoya. They also offered informational booths, prizes, and food.
</p>
<p>The former president of Navajo Nation, Russell Begaye, bought a domestic violence shelter in the Utah part of the Navajo reservation in late 2018. Begaye talked about how the reservation needs more services for victims of violence, “There’s a big need for domestic and family violence services on the Navajo Nation. In the past, we referred people out, to off-reservation services. In the last four years, we’ve built our capacity to handle these cases and provide services for the Navajo people.” This shelter will provide protection for women within the tribe affected by gendered violence.

     <h3>How Gendered Violence Affects the Community & Conclusion</h3>
     <hr><!--this draws a line across the page, which I put under each section heading in the example-->
<p>Gendered violence is clearly a major issue that the Navajo Nation is experiencing. The rates of violence against women is disproportionately large and is impacting the community on every level. The Navajo culture sees women as the most important gender because of their spiritual and traditional significance. Women play a huge part keeping the culture alive, whether it's through the annual Miss Navajo pageant or by being a part of time honored stories and beliefs. High rates of violence against women takes a toll on their influence in the community and undermines the role that they have. A society that places so much importance on women will be hurt when their women are hurt. The amount of violence that women have to endure starts to devalue their position in the society and on the reservation; the Navajo culture embraces equality between men and women, but this starts to break down with the amount of violence perpetrated on women. Not only does it affect the community, it has a detrimental effect on the women it happens to, which can lead them with poor mental health and other problems. The Navajo Nation is not the only Native American community that has challenges with gendered violence. It is a problem plaguing all Native communities and populations. The Navajo Nation is already making strides to combat violence against women whether it be through policy or community events that raise awareness. They are on their way to helping women and reducing perpetrators.
