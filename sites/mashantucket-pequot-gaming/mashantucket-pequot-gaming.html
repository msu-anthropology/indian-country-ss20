         <h3>Introduction</h3>
		 <hr><!--this draws a line across the page, which I put under each section heading in the example-->
		 <p>Sovereignty is the right of a people to govern over themselves, a right that many nations across what is now considered North America practiced unhindered. The Mashantucket Pequot Tribal Nation has called Connecticut home for over ten thousand years exercising this right. European arrival in the early 1600’s sought to undermine Indigenous self-government with subordination and eradication. Despite centuries of war, disease, and genocide, the Pequots have continued to persevere as a community and fight to get back their historic right to self government. </p>

     <p> Sovereignty encompasses all parts of a nation and the lives of its people. It allows them to make decisions in their own interest without fear of of outside intrusion. While in the United States, Tribal-Federal relations are not an equal nation-to-nation relationship, Federal Recognition acknowledges the Mashantucket Pequot Tribal Nation’s sovereignty and their ability to make decisions for themselves without State interference. With this power of self-determination, the nation has been able to open gaming facilities despite the protest of outside groups. They have the ability and authority to make decisions and exercise their sovereignty as they continue to operate gaming operations. </p>

     <h3>Fight for Sovereignty</h3>
     <hr><!--this draws a line across the page, which I put under each section heading in the example-->
     <p>	In the 1970s, the Federal Government of the United States started proceeding for Federal Recognition of Indigenous Nations. However, the Pequot nation had been never stopped being its own community. In the centuries before this, the Pequot community had remained against great attempts by the settler government. Having been granted a reservation in 1666 of 989 acres, the group whose numbers had been greatly reduced first by raging disease and then in the 1830’s the Pequot War, a genocidal conflict that ended with European victory and subjugation, the land allotted to the tribe was reduced greatly over the years by illegal land sale. By 1856, only 213 acres remained and the on-reservation population decreased as members left to find employment. When the possibility of land reclamation arose in the 70’s, many members demanded to have the wrongs against their community addressed. They brought the landowners on the illegally sold land to court. A settlement was reached that would recover the land, but for this to be accessible, they had to have federal recognition and so, in 1983 with the full support of the Connecticut legislature, they were successful (About).

     <h3>Sovereignty and Gaming</h3>
     <hr><!--this draws a line across the page, which I put under each section heading in the example-->
<p>Federal recognition allowed for something besides land reclamation, it made it possible for tribe to exercise their rights as a sovereign nation. While tribes in the United States do not possess a nation to nation relationship with the United States, recognized tribes have autonomy, though subordinate to the Federal government.
The Mashantucket Pequot Tribal Nation began this The right to self government has allowed the Pequot tribe to operate gaming operations. In 2006, 224 out of the 561 federally recognized tribes were recorded as managing some form of gaming in their community (The State 148). Gaming is a right that the Mashantucket Pequot are allowed to operate under their sovereign status, and with it they have transformed their community.</p>

     <h3>The Effect of Gaming on the Community</h3>
     <hr><!--this draws a line across the page, which I put under each section heading in the example-->
<p>Before the opening of the casino, life on the reservation was economically different and community was consistently neglected by the state.  The casino and its subsequent revenue allowed for greater self-sufficiency and the ability to revitalize and preserve culture and the community (Parsons). The Pequot Nation’s culture has faced repeated attempts at decimation that exists to this day as people continue to call them “fake Indians”. Genocide and centuries of forced assimilation have had a negative effect on the community, but the casino allows the Nation to be able to be independent and help revitalize their community and culture (Anthes).</p>
